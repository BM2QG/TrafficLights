Traffic Light Project. Simulates an intersection traffic light. I used 6 LED to represent two street traffic lights. Each LED was acompanied by a 220 ohm resistor.The arduino was used to time the voltage signal sent to each LED. When one traffic light was green or yellow, the other was in red just like a real traffic light. One way is at a stop while the other traffic is going or about to halt.
